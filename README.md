# About Me
**Tessa Volpe**  
Simmons University  
*Bachelors of Science in Data Science and Analytics, anticipated May 2026*  

I am a Data Science & Analytics student at Simmons University who is interested in how data can be used to better understand people, systems, and decisions. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, building clean visualizations, and exploring how data can drive meaningful impact, especially in areas like healthcare, sports, and education.
I am currently a NASA JSC Summer Intern and Fellow with MIT's Break Through Tech AI program. I am still early in my career and am eager to continue learning from coursework, hands-on projects, and the people around me. I care about asking good questions, communicating clearly, and doing work thatâ€™s thoughtful and useful.

# MIT-Break-Through-Tech-AI Project Portfolio
This [repository](https://github.com/tessa-v11/MIT-Break-Through-Tech-AI) contains projects I completed through my fellowship with Break Through Tech AI at MIT Schwartzman College of Computing

## Fall AI Studio Project placeholder

## Random Forest Model: Airbnb Review Score Prediction
A machine learning project predicting `review_scores_value` for Airbnb listings using linear regression and random forest models. This notebook follows the full machine learning lifecycle from problem definition, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.

Lab8 Project.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, model training (Linear Regression and Random Forest), evaluation metrics, and result visualizations.
- The project focuses on predicting `review_scores_value` using key host and listing features.

Processed Airbnb data (airbnbListingsData.zip)
- `calculated_host_listings_count`, `accommodate`s, `minimum_nights`, `availability_365`, `host_is_superhost`, `instant_bookable`. Missing values handled, categorical variables encoded, and ready for modeling.

## Logistic Regression Model: Airbnb Superhost Prediction
Trained logistic regression model and corresponding dataset used to predict whether an Airbnb is labeled a **Superhost**

Trained logistic regression model saved using pickle (ModelSelectionForLogisticRegression.pkl)
- This model can be reloaded and used for prediction using the same top features it was trained on.

Preprocessed Airbnb training data (airbnbData_train.csv)
- Includes one-hot encoding, scaled numeric features, and no missing values.
